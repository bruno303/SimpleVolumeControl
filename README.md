# Simple Volume Control

A simple application that calls for the system's volume panel.

After spend a lot of time testing apps from Play Store just for that and not finding anything good and free of ads, I decided to make my own.

Hope you enjoy :)

## How it works

To open the system's volume panel you can:

- use a widget
- use the quick settings (you must add it to your quick settings bar)
